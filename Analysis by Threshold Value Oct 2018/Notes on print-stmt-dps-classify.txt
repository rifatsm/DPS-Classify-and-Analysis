 # Python Script `print-stmt-dps-classify.py`
 	- About: 
 		- The script classifies projects into two categories, high and low scoring projects.
 		- This classification is achieved by using a threshold score, which is initially set to 50% of the total score
 	- Pros:

 	- Cons: 
 		- The threshold value is problematic. 
 		- We rather need to use dynamic values such as quartile values of all the scores for each of the projects 
 	- How to Use: 
 		- Run Step 1
 		- Run Step 2
